### USEFUL TERRAFORM COMMANDS

* ```terraform init``` - initialize system (downloads plugins).
* ```terraform plan``` - plan operations - initializes state file.
* ```terraform apply``` - deploy resources.
* ```terraform destroy``` - tear down resources.

After running ```terraform plan``` output will look something like:

```
# aws_vpc.demo_vpc will be created
  + resource "aws_vpc" "demo_vpc" {
      + arn                              = (known after apply)
      + assign_generated_ipv6_cidr_block = false
      + cidr_block                       = "10.0.0.0/16"
      + default_network_acl_id           = (known after apply)
      + default_route_table_id           = (known after apply)
      + default_security_group_id        = (known after apply)
      + dhcp_options_id                  = (known after apply)
      + enable_classiclink               = (known after apply)
      + enable_classiclink_dns_support   = (known after apply)

      + id                               = (known after apply)
      + instance_tenancy                 = "default"
      + ipv6_association_id              = (known after apply)
